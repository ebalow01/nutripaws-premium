### 👨‍⚕️ EXPERT VETERINARY ADVICE
**Q&A with Dr. Marina Rodriguez, DVM, Board Certified Veterinary Nutritionist**

**Q: "My three indoor cats seem lethargic in the summer heat. Should I be concerned?"**

*Dr. Rodriguez:* "Indoor cats are actually safer from heat-related illness, but they can still experience discomfort. Ensure multiple water sources, consider cooling mats, and watch for excessive panting. Premium wet food provides additional hydration that's especially beneficial during hot months."

**Q: "How do I maintain my hunting dogs' performance nutrition during summer?"**

*Dr. Rodriguez:* "Working dogs need 20-30% more calories during active seasons, but timing is crucial. Feed smaller, frequent meals and avoid feeding 2 hours before intensive activity. High-quality protein supports muscle recovery in heat stress."

**Q: "What about exotic pets - are there universal summer care guidelines?"**

*Dr. Rodriguez:* "Each species has unique needs, but universal principles include: stable temperatures, increased water access, and nutrition that supports thermal regulation. Consult species-specific care guides."

### 💝 CUSTOMER SUCCESS STORIES
**"From Stressed to Satisfied: How Premium Nutrition Helped Luna Through Fireworks Season"**

*By Jennifer M., NutriPaws Customer Since 2023*

"Last July 4th was a nightmare. Luna, my 7-year-old calico, hid under the bed for three days straight. This year, after 6 months on NutriPaws Premium with their stress-support formula, she barely flinched during the neighborhood fireworks! The L-tryptophan and magnesium in their formula really works. Worth every penny for peace of mind."

**Before:** Severe anxiety, hiding, loss of appetite during loud events
**After:** Calm demeanor, maintained eating schedule, slept through fireworks

*Dr. Rodriguez comments: "Proper nutrition absolutely supports nervous system health. Jennifer's experience reflects what we see clinically - premium ingredients make a measurable difference in stress resilience."*
